Dotfiles
============

These are all my dotfiles, organized by application. They are meant to be configured with the help of GNU Stow, a fantastic application that I recommend everybody use to manage their configuration files.

Installation
-------------

Simply clone to a directory, then run
    stow folder

where "folder" is the folder of the application you want to set up. Easy!
